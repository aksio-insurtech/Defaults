## ExceptionShouldBeSpecific

As with all other code; Exceptions has meaning. You should therefor not be throwing
generic exceptions provided by the .NET base class library as these does not have
a specific meaning. This rule prevents you from throwing any exception that comes from
any `System` namespace. Your exception should sit side-by-side the code that is
throwing it. There is one exception to the rule; it allows throwing [NotImplementedException](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.notimplementedexception).

Example of good specific exceptions:

- WriteableImmutableFieldsFound
- WriteableImmutablePropertiesFound
- InvalidVersionString
- UnableToProvideConfigurationObject
- CannotInvokeMethodBecauseTargetIsNotAlive
