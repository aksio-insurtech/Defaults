## MethodElementsMustAppearInTheCorrectOrder

Methods must after fields/properties/delegates/events/constructors/indexers.

Private and public methods can be mixed, but please put the public ones first.
Support-methods only used by one public method can be grouped with the public method, private methods used by several other methods should be placed at the end of the class.

The expected order of elements in a class is:
- Fields/Properties
- Delegates
- Events
- Constructors
- Finalizer
- Indexer
- *Methods*
