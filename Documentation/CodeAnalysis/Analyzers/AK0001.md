## SerializableNotAllowed

The use of the attribute `[Serializable]`is only needed for things that will be
serialized typically by the built-in binary serializer. This used to be something
needed to be done for types that was going to be marshalled between different
[AppDomains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/application-domains)
within the same process. At Aksio we do not promote the practice of having
multiple AppDomains within a single process, as we rely on process isolation from
the underlying operating system instead.

A common scenario you'll also see is that the use of the `[Serializable]` attribute
comes standard from templates for runtime exceptions. But again, for the same
reason.
