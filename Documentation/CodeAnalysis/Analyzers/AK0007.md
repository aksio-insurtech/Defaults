## ExceptionDescriptionShouldFollowStandard

This rule makes sure the API summary description of an exception adheres to
a standard text. The text should start with `Exception that is thrown when`.

Below is an example of good use:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Exception that is thrown when a target is not alive in a weak reference.
/// </summary>
public class CannotInvokeMethodBecauseTargetIsNotAlive : ArgumentException
{
}
```
