## PropertiesMustAppearInTheCorrectOrder

Fields must appear in the correct order in a class.

Fields and properties can be mixed, but please place them logically to each other when relevant.

The expected order of elements in a class is:
- *Fields/Properties*
- Delegates
- Events
- Constructors
- Finalizer
- Indexer
- Methods
