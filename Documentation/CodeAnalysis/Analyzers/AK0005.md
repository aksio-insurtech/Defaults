## ExceptionShouldOnlyHaveOneConstructor

Your custom exception should not have more than one constructors.
The constructor should be specific and representative for the exception,
not a generic constructor suggesting the exception is meant for multiple
purpose - which in turn means violating the single responsibility principle.

There are expectations related to the constructor of exceptions, which is
governed by [DL0006](./DL0006.md).
